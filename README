# Workflo

Small application that aims to help people to sustain a healthy 
working style, specifically for people working behind a screen 
for the majority of their day.

Aim is for this to be a cross platform application, but currently
Windows is the main focus.

## Prerequisites for development

The application is built using Qt 5.7.9 MSVC2013, but any newer
version of Qt should work. See the website (http://www.qt.io)
for getting setup to do Qt development. All UI elements are 
developed in QML, whereas the main business logic is C++.
